## The Goal

The objective of this app was to learn about animations and how to incorporate Firebase into our Flutter apps. Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package was used to equip the app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.


## Result

I was able to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
